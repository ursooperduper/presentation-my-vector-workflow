# Don't think... Draw

* Year-long character design project
* (At least) one sketch per day
* Sketches get posted to Instagram
* Each drawing is converted to a vector (periodically)
* Year-end wrap-up: mega-poster/mural?

# Workflow

* Sketch
* Scan
* Vector
* Share

The key to this (very manual) workflow is that you have to love every step, otherwise you'll want to automate it. I want my finished work to feel hand-drawn, so it's important that I have my hands deep in each step.

# Illustrator Tips

### Pen Tool, FTW

* Learn it & love it.
* Bezier Curves are your best friend.

### Build a texture library

* Find/take photos and convert them to textures

### Build a vector library

* Carefully construct vectors so that individual elements are detachable & reusable.

# Illustrator Tips

### Vectors

* Keep curve handles tight and even.
* Try to use as few anchor points as possible.

### Random

* Use the Appearance Panel to experiment with different effects
